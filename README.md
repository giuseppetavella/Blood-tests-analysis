# Blood Analysis

## Context
Is there any pattern in my blood, anything interesting? 
I can't make sense of it just by staring at those numbers. 
Is there anything in my blood that has any kind of pattern or relationship with anything else?
I understand some values are 'low', but what does that mean, really? 
By how much? Compared to what scale? In another scale, would they still be low? 
What is the safety margin in which we can say that even if a value is low, it's nothing to be worried about?


## Background
I've been a blood donor for years with AVIS (Italian Association Blood Volunteers), and after each donation I get free blood results tests.
Neutrophils, lymphocites, platelets etc. For years I've looked at the results wondering.
I could see some values were high or low, but when my programming and data skills started to catch up, I wondered how I could analyze all of this.
Now I'm looking forward to donating my blood even more = more data! :) 


## Data
The blood data is 100% original personal data,  I've chosen to share it publicly to contribute in creating maybe some more advanced software for disease prediction or something like that. As long as it improves people's lives! 
In this dataset there are only 11 observations. This is the only drawback at the moment.
I'm completely aware this is not statistically significant for drawing insights, however the matter touches me personally, and for me this is much more motivating to work on than any other "big real life dataset" on topics I'm not interested in.


## Prerequisites
The data needs to be in .csv format. 
In the future I plan on implementing a feature where you can take a picture of the blood results (literally, the paper they give you), upload the picture, and the program will automatically analyze that data.
However for now if the data is not in csv format already, unfortunately it needs to be first typed manually.
